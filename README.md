# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Refactor Horiseon website

## In this project I corrected some code to make the index.html file easier to read and follow. 

## Corrections to code
Added a descriptive title element. Made H1 tag easier to understand. Made H4 instead of H2 in footer. Corrected a nav link that was missing an id="".
Added alt attributes to images. 

I made it so that you would see semantic HTML elements in source code.
I corrected some code so that elements follow logical structure.
Made heading attributes follow sequential order.
I corrected the codebase so that it follows accesibility standards.
